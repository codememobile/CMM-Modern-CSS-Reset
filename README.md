# CMM-Modern-CSS-Reset 2020
A reset that I put together/tested with help from other MIT resets.

This file will be updated as seen fit. Should suffice for your normalization needs in 2020!

## Thanks!
Thanks to sindresorhus (https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) for his modern take on normalize which I incorporated some of his techniques.
